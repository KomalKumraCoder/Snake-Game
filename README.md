# Snake-Game
It is a project in which we will get knowledge about 2d matrix and linked list.
First Task:We have to create a 2d matrix and a snake with node having one character, x and y axis and a next pointer.We also have to create food with a character along with x and y axis.

Second Task:The snake can not cross 2d matrix then we have used floodfill algorithm.

Third Task:Now we have to create movement in snake.
We have done this by firstly equating characters like u for up and moving snake by using x nd y axis but then we have used the up , down , right and left through keyboard.

Additional Functions:
Reverse Snake
Convert  linked list to String
Store String in File
